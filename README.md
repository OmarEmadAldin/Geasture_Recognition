# Gesture Recognition for Robot Control

This project focuses on recognizing specific hand gestures from video input and translating them into commands that can control a robot.

---

## 🎯 Problem Definition

In many applications, especially robotics, it is important to control the system hands-free and intuitively.  

**Objective:**
- Recognize predefined gestures in real-time.
- Output corresponding string commands (e.g., `MOVE FORWARD`, `STOP`).
- Integrate these commands to drive or control a robot platform.

This solution uses MediaPipe and a custom-trained model to detect gestures robustly.

## 🗂️ Files Overview

Below is a description of the key files included in this repository:

---

### 📄 `Required_Solution`

This document outlines the **project requirements and specifications**, including:
- The target gestures to detect.
- Expected command outputs for each gesture.
- Integration expectations with the robot control system.
- Performance criteria (accuracy, latency).

Use this as the main reference for project scope and deliverables.

---

### 🧠 `Trained_gestures`

This folder contains:
- The trained gesture recognition model data.
- Any relevant labels or metadata describing which gestures the model supports.

This model is loaded by the recognition pipeline to classify gestures in real-time.

---

### 🗂️ `gesture_recognizer.task`

This file is a **MediaPipe Model Task** (TFLite format), which encapsulates:
- The trained model weights.
- The label map associating output indices to gesture names.
- Any preprocessing and postprocessing operations.

This file is essential for running the recognition pipeline in production or test environments.

---

### 📝 `test.ipynb`

A **Jupyter Notebook** used for:
- Loading and testing the trained model.
- Running inference on sample images or video streams.
- Visualizing detection outputs and verifying predictions.
- Debugging and validation before deployment.

Use this notebook to experiment, evaluate performance, and ensure the model is behaving as expected.

## 🚀 Usage Overview

1️⃣ **Train or update the model** (if needed)  
2️⃣ **Deploy `gesture_recognizer.task`** to the application  
3️⃣ **Run the recognition pipeline** to capture gestures  
4️⃣ **Send output strings** to the robot controller over your preferred communication channel (e.g., serial, network)  
5️⃣ **Robot receives commands and performs actions accordingly**
